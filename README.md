- bs4: BeautifulSoup object is provided by Beautiful Soup which is a web scraping framework for Python. Web scraping is the process of extracting data from the website using automated tools to make the process faster.
- pandas: Pandas is a library made over the NumPy library which provides various data structures and operators to manipulate the numerical data.
